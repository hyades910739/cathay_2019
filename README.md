# Cathay_2019
### About
This repo implement some sequential recommendation model for session-based Recommendations. Models and Loss function are implemented on Pytorch, including:   
* RNN-based model (Ref. Session-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks)  
* CNN-based model (Ref. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification)
* Loss function : BPR loss and Negative sampling loss.


### Dependency  
including (but not limited to)...  
* python 3.6
* torch v.1.2.0
* numpy v.1.14.5
* pandas v.0.23.0
* gensim v.3.4.0  

### HOW TO USE
stay away with sh*ttly code, just...  
1. put `cathay_test/` in `./` 
2. run `train.sh`, train the miserable model
